# Electronic_Inverter_Design_Analysis
Regression Analysis of Electronic Inverter Design Parameters.

## Purpose:
This project explores the performance of electronic inverters by analyzing the relationship between transistor dimensions, operational setpoints, and their transient performance.
The objective is to identify key design parameters and their interactions that significantly influence transient response, enabling optimization of inverter performance.

## Parameters
Regression Analysis was done on SAS to evaluate the impact of transistor dimensions (WidthNMOS, LengthNMOS, WidthPMOS, LengthPMOS) and operational setpoints (Setpoint) on transient response (TransientPt). 
3 models, including 1 indicator and 2 interaction models were used to assess main effects and higher-order interactions, with diagnostic plots for model evaluation.
